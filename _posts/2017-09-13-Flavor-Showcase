We'll try to do the following thing:
Write an app that shows random image from Reddit
Create two flavors
In one use Picassa, in second use Glide
Do not have dependencies of the other lib in flavors.
Provide additional layer of abstraction for image handling
Dagger @Inject image provider
Keep it clean and simple. Clean and simple.
