## We'll try to do the following thing:
* cwite an app that shows random image from lorempixel
* create two flavors
* use Picasso in first flavor, in second use Glide
* keep Glide and Picasso imports far away from main code
* provide additional layer of abstraction for image handling
* @Inject image provider
* keep it clean and simple

## First of all - create and setup project.

### Configure flavors

### Add dependencies

### Setup Glide and Picasso in separate flavors.

## Make our view with image and text

### MainActivity
```xml
<layout>

<ImageView
    id="@+id/image"
/>

</layout>
```

## Write some interfaces

### The callback way

### The reactive way

## Implementation time
