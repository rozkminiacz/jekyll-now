# Motivation
Few years ago we started huge city app project. It is more-or-less generic app providing different features
for tourists and local people too. Main functionality was to send hot deals and special offers to app users.
You walk across the city - you get notification that with this code you can buy burger with 20% discount.

But that's enough about app itself. The problem is, that codebase was huge and packaging was horrible.
All the fragments in one directory, some of them had presenters, direct implementations
and MainActivity with 2000 lines. 

Nobody wants to dive into that kind of code. 

Suddenly - we were given a new task. **add gamification to app**

*Gamification is basically bunch of techniques to use game mechanism in business and real life* 

# Adding module to legacy code

# How to determine way to split app into modules?

# Managing multi-module apps
